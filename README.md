### `JUST ANOTHER MARKTPLAATS`
This project was intended for hobby and educational purposes only, during my course at Codaisseur (Class 25, May/April/June 2019). 

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Initial installment
Use 'npm install' to download all necessary dependencies
